"""Register a derived belief in the WMTM (Working Medium-Term Memory).

When the agent draws a new conclusion from recalled facts, it should
register the derivation here so WMTM can track it, boost its attention
when useful, and promote it to LTM if it proves durable.

Uses file-based IPC: writes to memory/_wmtm_pending_derives.jsonl
which the wmtm_context transformation picks up on the next cycle.
